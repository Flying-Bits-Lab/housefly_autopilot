# Housefly Autopilot

In a simple drone (quadcopter), a pilot only controls the speed of the motors. By adjusting the motors' speed individually, they can maneuver the flying vehicle. In the real world, pilots make each action based on the perceived result of their previous actions until the goal is achieved. An autopilotâ€™s perception is based on sensor data, such as angle, position, altitude, etc.
